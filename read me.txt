Shopping API;;;

This is a simple shopping interface implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework. The interface allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and view the cart items.

Features;;;
Select and filter products by category
View product details, including title, price, rating, and image
Add products to the cart
View the cart items in a modal window


Usage;;;
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Upon opening the application, you will see a header with the title "Shopping Online" and a shopping cart icon.
The left column displays a category select dropdown. Choose a category to filter the products accordingly.
The middle column shows the product cards dynamically generated using JavaScript. Each card displays the product's image, title, price, rating, and an "Add to Cart" button.
Clicking the "Add to Cart" button will add the selected product to the cart.
The right column features a button labeled "Your Cart Items" with a cart icon. Clicking this button will open a modal window displaying the cart items.
In the cart modal, you can view the products you added to the cart, including their titles, prices, and preview images.
Close the cart modal by clicking the close button or anywhere outside the modal.
API Integration
This application integrates with the Fake Store API to fetch and display product data. The API provides endpoints to retrieve product categories and individual products.
